# Breathing App

A React Native mobile app for guided Wim Hof Method breathing exercises with session tracking and customisation.

## Features

- **Guided Breathing Sessions** - Automated visual animations and audio cues for the complete Wim Hof breathing cycle
- **Session History** - Local storage of all completed sessions with breath hold times
- **Customisable Protocols** - Adjustable breaths per round, number of rounds, and recovery breath duration
- **Minute Markers** - Audio notification every minute during breath holds to track progress
- **Always-On Display** - Screen stays awake during active sessions
- **Privacy-First** - All data stored locally on device, no account required

## The Wim Hof Method

The Wim Hof Method breathing technique consists of:

1. **Active Breathing Phase** - 30 deep breaths (inhale fully through nose/mouth, exhale without force)
2. **Breath Hold Phase** - After the last exhale, hold breath as long as comfortable
3. **Recovery Breath** - One deep inhale, hold for 15 seconds, then release
4. **Repeat** - Complete 3-4 rounds total

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Android Studio with Android SDK
- Samsung S24 (or any Android device) with developer mode enabled
- `npx` available globally

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- StorageService.test.ts
```

### Code Quality

```

## Building for Release

### Generate Keystore

```bash
cd android/app
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore breathing-app-release.keystore -alias breathing-app -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

### Build APK

```bash
# Build release APK
npx react-native build-android --mode=release

# Install on device
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

## Audio Setup

Audio files need to be placed in `android/app/src/main/res/raw/`:

- `breathe_in.mp3` - "Breathe in" (~1 second)
- `breathe_out.mp3` - "Breathe out" (~1 second)
- `hold_breath.mp3` - "Hold your breath" (~2 seconds)
- `minute_marker.mp3` - Bell or voice notification for minute markers (~1 second)
- `recovery_breath.mp3` - "Take a deep breath in and hold" (~3 seconds)
- `release.mp3` - "Release" (~1 second)
- `round_complete.mp3` - "Round complete" (~2 seconds)

You can record these yourself or use text-to-speech tools to generate them.

## Safety

⚠️ **Always practice breathing exercises while seated or lying down.**

Never practice while driving, in water, or in any situation where loss of consciousness could be dangerous.

## Customisation

The app allows you to customise:

- **Breaths per round**: 10-50 breaths (default: 30)
- **Number of rounds**: 1-10 rounds (default: 3)
- **Recovery breath hold**: 10-30 seconds (default: 15)

## Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **Screens** - UI components for Dashboard, Settings, and Session
- **Hooks** - React hooks for state management (session state machine)
- **Services** - Business logic layer (storage, audio)
- **Components** - Reusable UI components
- **Utils** - Pure utility functions
